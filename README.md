Connect‑One (Frontend Only)
⚠️ Service Notice

The backend/API for Connect‑One has been decommissioned. This repository now contains the frontend only. You can still run and explore the UI locally using a mock API. Production features that required the real server (auth persistence, database writes, email, etc.) are disabled.

TL;DR

✅ Frontend works (React).

❌ Backend is shut down (endpoints return 410 Gone).

🧪 Try it locally with a mock API (JSON Server or MSW).

About

Connect‑One is a community platform designed to support first‑generation college students with mentorship matching, an events calendar, forums, and resource sharing. This repo currently preserves the user interface so collaborators, reviewers, and recruiters can evaluate the product’s design and flows.
